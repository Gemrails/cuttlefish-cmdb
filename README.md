# Cuttlefish CMDB
Configuration Management Database leveraging Neo4j (graph database). Represents networks as they exist irl. 

This project is still in its fetal stage... it barely has a skeleton and doesn't really do anything... yet.

## Testing

Warning: Testing will clear the local Neo4j database. Do not test if you have important data loaded.
